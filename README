This is basically just the test for Go's webapp capabilities.

Make sure you're in the "gowiki" directory in whatever terminal you're executing this test from.

Use "go build wiki.go" to compile and "./wiki" to initialize it.

Go to "http://localhost:8080/view/test" to view the webapp from your machine.
